# Lazy BLE
Just a BLE wrapper for my own use.
This is currently under development and may not work properly until it reaches `v1.0.0`. Therefore, it is not recommended for use at this time.

# Tips
If you want to try the ***basic*** example, replace `board` under `[env]` in `platformio.ini` with the board you have, and then execute `pio run -e basic -t upload`.
Note that I am using the M5 series, so the examples are specific to them.
